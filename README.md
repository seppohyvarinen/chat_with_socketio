# Chat application using React, Node and Socket.IO library.

Application is deployed at render.com: https://sockeio-chat.onrender.com/

This is my thesis work, a chat application created using Node.js and React.js with Socket.IO library. The thesis itself presents reader with step-by-step guide
on how to create a realtime chat application that works in a web browser. The language used is JavaScript and frameworks are React.js at the frontend and Node.js runtime with Express.js library at the backend. 
Socket.IO library is connected to both frontend and backend. The application was fairly straightforward to produce, and it goes to show how user friendly the Socket.IO library is. 
As a conclusion, it is highly likely that Socket.IO will be a relevant and used library in the future as well. My thesis can be read here:

The app is updated frequently.
